# Linear-Regression-House-Price-Prediction

# 🏠 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using Scikit-learn to predict house prices based on features such as area, bedrooms, and bathrooms.

## 🎯 Objective
To understand regression modeling, model evaluation, and interpretation of machine learning results.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Dataset
House Price Prediction Dataset containing housing features and price values.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Data preprocessing
2. Train-test split
3. Linear Regression model training
4. Prediction on test data
5. Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R² score
6. Visualization of regression line

## 📈 Model Equation
Price = 2512254.26 + 425.73 × Area

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MSE (Mean Squared Error)
- R² Score

## 🧠 Key Learning
- Regression modeling
- Model evaluation techniques
- Feature interpretation

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add multiple features
- Feature scaling
- Try advanced regression models
